  <OverView Text="This section allows Administrators to handle some of the tasks that are required when 
                    using the Membership and Profile classes.  
                    Each tab provides unique functionality from managing creation and deletion of users to managing 
                    user's roles and profiles.  From a user's perspective this section allows them to view and update 
                    thier own information such as password and profile.  An administrator can manipulate all the user's information.
                    In the Configure Users section there are examples of programmatically handling administrative
                    tasks as well as dynamically producing controls.  The MultiView, the GridView and DetailsView, the XML control 
                    and the ChangePassword web server controls are demonstrated as well as Web Parts." />
